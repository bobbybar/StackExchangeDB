# StackExchangeDB

This report is formatted slightly differently than the others I have done. Using SQLite3, I explore the database of StackExchange. Due to the large size of the database, I will not explain the schema here, but will refer you to a stackexchange article which details it:

I answer questions about the data set in increasing complexity to exhibit an understanding of SQLite. I will not be able to upload the version of the database used for this project (version from May 2023) since the size is too large. The data dump can be found here:
